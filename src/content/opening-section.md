Welcome to my [zine-inspired](http://www.phrack.org/) digital portfolio!

From tinkering with Arduino kits and HTML quiz websites in primary school to my recent dual graduation from the Univeristy of New South Wales with a BE (Hons) in Mechatronic Engineering and BSc in Computer Science, I have always loved designing and building projects which bridge the gap between software and hardware.

This site serves as both a personal and professional showcase of my journey and technical abilities. Feel free to browse!
