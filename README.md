## Development

### Bugs
- [ ] Delay before project section disappears
- [ ] Google pixel stretched ascii ART (space shrinking)
- [ ] Messenger preview stretched ascii ART
- [ ] Images massive on zoom out
- [ ] Image captions
- [X] Scroll shows full header section

### MVP TODO
- [ ] Fill in the projects (aim for 10)
- [ ] Put the read-more button on the bottom somehow and let the thing expand the full way to the right
- [ ] Change to a softer colour theme
- [ ] Decide whether to do work projects?
- [ ] Have a project text interpreter
- [ ] Make engaging catch phrases
- [ ] Put ASCII art in the skills section and fill that out (a grid would be nice)
    - programming languages
    - familiar platforms: arduino, raspberry pi
- [ ] Add some sort of third section (showcase, resume, qualifications)
- [X] favicon_icon
- [X] Fix introductory text to be shorter, not mention my name twice and be engaging.
- [X] Fix timeline VLine toggle fade


### Feature Ideas
- [ ] More readable main font
- [ ] Scale whitespace to make a coverpage of for the entry point
- [ ] Highlight project button and ranking on scroll focus
- [ ] Sticky header with navigation and toggle theme button: fade after scrolling past the last section of contents (?)
- [ ] Window terminal emulator style, previous commands, help with other features
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Ranking system: timeline, complexity (stars), time invested
- [ ] Tags for filtering: software, hardware
- [ ] Interactive bouncing ball simulator
- [ ] Rotating ASCII art scan of my smiling head
- [ ] Make the Divider into a section component with child input
- [x] Buttons with icons
